#About Us
StudyBuddy was created because we saw how hard it was to find a study buddy especially for those already out of school.
We sought out to create a platform where users can find other buddies to help further their understanding and learning.
In the future, we want StudyBuddy to help connect students of all subjects and include in-house learning content.
StudyBuddy was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, MySQl, Materialize and Node.
